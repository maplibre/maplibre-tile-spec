## Tile Structure
Top level structure of a tile is a sequence of layers, where each layer consists of `(size, tag, data)` tuples:
- `size: varint` - size of the data block in bytes, including the size of the `tag` field
- `tag: varint` - identifies the block type, e.g. `0x01 = feature table v1`, `0x02 = raster layer`, `0x03 = routing table`, etc. We only define `0x01` for now.
- `data: u8[]` - the actual data block of the specified size

This approach allows us to easily extend the format in the future by adding new block types, while keeping backward compatibility. Parsers can skip unknown block types by reading the `size` and moving forward accordingly. For now, we only define `0x01` for vector layers, and possibly a few more if needed.

Note the ordering -- `tag` is after the `size` because it is possible to treat it as a single byte for now until the parser supports more than 127 types, and can efficiently skip unknown ones without doing a more expensive varint parsing.

## Layer 0x01 - MVT compatibility
Structure of the data if the `tag` above is 0x01. We should focus this tag on MVT compatibility, offering exactly what we had in MVT, but allowing for a clearly defined set of encodings and other optimizations like tesselation.  No new data formats (per vertix data, nested data, 3d geometries, etc).  No extendable encodings - once finalized, 0x01 will only allow what has been specified. This will ensure that if a decoder declares "0x01" support, it will parse every specification-compliant 0x01 layer. For any new features and encodings we will simply use a new tag ID, likely reusing most of the existing encoding/decoding code.

- `name: string` - Name of the layer
- `columnCount: varint` - Number of columns in the layer
- each column is defined as:
    - `columnType: varint` - same idea as `tag` above, e.g. `1 = id`, `2 = geometry`, `3 = int property`, etc.

## Code Structure
Given the raw input bytes, the parser quickly runs over the input slice and only stores references to the streams and their metadata. Later, decoding can be done on-demand, either for all columns, or just for the specific ones. This example is for `Id`, but the same idea applies to `Geometry`, `Property`, and `FeatureTable` entities.

* **`RawId` struct** contains references into the original input data. The values are not decoded, just some metadata is parsed. Most data is stored as `Stream<'a>` instances, which hold references to parts of the original input and tie to input lifetime.
* **`OwnedRawId` struct** is auto-generated with the [borrowme crate](https://docs.rs/borrowme/latest/borrowme/) - it has the same fields as the `RawId` struct, but owns its data. This is useful when you want to store a `RawId` struct beyond the lifetime of the original input slice, or when you want to modify it or store the result of the encoding before storing it into a file.
* **`DecodedId` struct** is used to store the decoded value. At the moment, only `DecodedGeometry` is implemented, but the same idea applies to other entities. The decoded values are stored in standard Rust types, e.g. `Vec<u64>` for IDs.
* **`Id` enum** contains `Raw(RawId)` and `Decoded(DecodedId)` variants, with values described above. This allows `in-place` decoding, e.g. it is possible to decode just one property column / ID / Geometry, while keeping the rest in their raw form. The enum also has a corresponding `borrowme`-generated `OwnedId`.
